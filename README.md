# ESP32 Serial to Serial BT (Classic)

Based on [this source](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/api/bluetooth.html#serial-to-serial-bt) with improvements.

It uses the esp-idf & arduino libraries on PlatformIO.

Make sure the Bluetooth MAC address of the device that needs to be paired is set in the code.
